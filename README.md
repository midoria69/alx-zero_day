My first readme on my repository I learned to clone my repository git clone "repository address eg:https://github.com/midoria69/pre_course.git" Create folders depending on whether you are on mac or windows mkdir "your folder name" Create files on mac touch "name.extension" on windows echo "name.extension" create a branch git branch.
